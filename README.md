## Usage

### Supported methylation heterogeneity measures

`Metheor` supports seven methylation heterogeneity measures in total.

**Proportion of discordant reads (PDR)**

![PDR](img/pdr.png)

PDR is defined as a fraction of reads carrying CpGs in discordant methylation states (i.e. containing both methylated and unmethylated CpGs in a single read) with respect to all reads mapped to a CpG.
```
metheor pdr --input <input.bam> --output <output.tsv>
    --min-depth <min_depth> --min-cpgs <min_cpgs>
    --min-qual <min_qual> --cpg-set <cpg_set.bed>
```

*Options*

- `-i, --input`: Path to input BAM file.
- `-o, --output`: Path to output table file summarizing the result of PDR calculation.
- `-d, --min-depth`: Minimum depth of CpG stretches to consider. [default: 10]
- `-p, --min-cpgs`: Minimum number of consecutive CpGs in a CpG stretch to consider. [default: 10]
- `-q, --min-qual`: Minimum quality for a read to be considered [default: 10]
- `-c, --cpg-set`: (Optional) Specify a predefined set of CpGs (in BED file) to be analyzed.

**Local pairwise methylation disorder (LPMD)**

![LPMD](img/lpmd.png)

We introduce LPMD as a new measure to quantify the local concordance of DNA methylation states.
The conceptual basis of LPMD is similar to PDR as they both are aware of local homogeneity of DNA methylation states, but they are different in that LPMD explicitly takes the distance between CpGs into consideration.
In detail, LPMD is defined as a fraction of CpG pairs within a given range of genomic distance (i.e., CpG pairs more distant than m basepairs and closer than M basepairs) and therefore, LPMD is defined for a *pair* of CpGs, but not for a single CpG.
Importantly, we note that while there is an increased tendency of observing discordant reads solely by change, according to the definition in PDR, as the sequencing read gets longer, LPMD is not dependent on the length of sequencing reads.

```
metheor lpmd --input <INPUT> --output <OUTPUT> [OPTIONS]
```

*Options*

- `-i, --input`: Path to input BAM file.
- `-o, --output`: Path to output table file summarizing the result of LPMD calculation.
- `-p, --pairs`: (Optional) Concordance information for all CpG pairs.
- `-m, --min-distance`: Minimum distance between CpG pairs to consider. [default: 2]
- `-M, --max-distance`: Maximum distance between CpG pairs to consider. [default: 16]
- `-q, --min-qual`: Minimum quality for a read to be considered. [default: 10]
- `-c, --cpg-set`: (Optional) Specify a predefined set of CpGs (in BED file) to be analyzed.

**Methylation haplotype load (MHL)**

```
metheor mhl --input <input.bam> --output <output.tsv>
    --min-depth <min-depth> --min-cpgs <min-cpgs> --min-qual <min-qual>
    --cpg-set <cpg-set.bed>
```

*Options*
- `-i, --input`: Path to input BAM file.
- `-o, --output`: Path to output table file summarizing the result of epipolymorphism calculation.
- `-d, --min-depth`: Minimum depth of reads covering epialleles to consider. [default: 10]
- `-c, --min-cpgs`: Minimum number of consecutive CpGs in a CpG stretch to consider.
- `-q, --min-qual`: Minimum quality for a read to be considered. [default: 10]
- `-c, --cpg-set`: (Optional) Specify a predefined set of CpGs (in BED file) to be analyzed.


**Epipolymorphism (PM)**

Landan et al., proposed another measure named epipolymorphism (PM), which also captures the amount of heterogeneity of DNA methylation for a given genomic region. The relationship between ME and PM is analogous to that between entropy and Gini index used for decision trees, and they can be considered as similar measures of DNA methylation heterogeneity in general. Using `metheor`, PM can be calculated with the command below:
```
metheor pm --input <input.bam> --output <output.tsv>
    --min-depth <min-depth> --min-qual <min-qual> --cpg-set <cpg-set.bed>
```

*Options*

- `-i, --input`: Path to input BAM file.
- `-o, --output`: Path to output table file summarizing the result of epipolymorphism calculation.
- `-d, --min-depth`: Minimum depth of reads covering epialleles to consider. [default: 10]
- `-q, --min-qual`: Minimum quality for a read to be considered. [default: 10]
- `-c, --cpg-set`: (Optional) Specify a predefined set of CpGs (in BED file) to be analyzed.

**Methylation entropy (ME)**

Xie et al. proposed an information theoretic measure called methylation entropy (ME), which is calculated as the entropy of epialleles originating from a single genomic locus. 
```
metheor me --input <INPUT> --output <OUTPUT>
    --min-depth <min-depth> --min-qual <min-qual> --cpg-set <cpg-set.bed>
```

*Options*

- `-i, --input`: Path to input BAM file.
